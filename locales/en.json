      "Hi there, my name is Sabolch Vargha, and I’m currently looking for a job. I have a bachelor’s degree in software engineering. At the moment I am working freelance in Uzghorod, Ukraine. I am a Web Developer and I specialize in creating websites. For the past 2 years, I've been developing applications for the web using mostly PHP. I do this for a living and love what I do as every day there is something new and exciting to learn.",
      "Coding have been my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found myself into programing since 2014. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional websites. Aside from web development, I enjoy spending my time in nature. Thank you for reading until the end ;)",
